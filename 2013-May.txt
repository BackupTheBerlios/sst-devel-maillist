Subject: [Sst-devel] Patch for killing supercommander by supernova
Message-ID: <CAMrm7HOw7HAxu2Dd3hiDcL4EJv7iRzhSNJdc4QVasoKeWCx9Rg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I ran across a bug where killing the supercommander with a supernova
(e.g., via armed deep space probe) marks an extra klingon as dead. If you
later kill all remaining klingons in one turn, the game becomes unwinnable
with -1 klingons left.

The attached patch fixes the supernova + supercommander kill detection
logic similarly to the supernova + commander kill detection logic in both
the Python version and the C version.
