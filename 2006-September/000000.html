<PRE>THE PEOPLE:

  Dave Matuszek -- one of the principal co-authors of the original FORTAN SST

  Tom Almy -- FORTRAN-to-C translator and keeper of the flame for many years

  Stas Sergeev -- author of the curses interface in SST2K

  Eric Raymond -- curator of the Retrocomputing Museum

THE PURPOSE:

SST is both historically important and a game that retains considerable
play value even in our graphics- and GUI-obsessed age.  The aims of the
SST2K project are these:

1) Support something as close to the 'original' SST experience as
   reasonably possible, so people can get a feel for life in the day of
   the TTY and understand the game's place in history.

2) Support updated interfaces in more modern styles while preserving
   the logic, humor, and design philosophy of the original game.

3) Respectfully carry forward the tradition, improving the game.

THE STATE OF PLAY:

Stas and I have done one release, 2.0.1, since reviving the code.  The
major feature addition has been a curses-based interface.  

I have refactored the heck out of the internals, cleaned up many
FORTRANisms, and separated the game engine from the UI; I believe the
code is now reasonably clean C and long-term maintainable.

There are no known bugs.  The original code seems to have had
an exceptionally low defect rate; Stas and I believe we've
succeeded in not increasing it.  We did have to fix a small 
handful of bugs we introduced ourselves.

The project needs a Web page at Berlios.

THE LICENSING SITUATION:

The license I found on the program documentation reads 

    Permission is hereby granted for the copying, distribution,
    modification and use of this program and associated documentation
    for recreational purposes, provided that all references to the
    authors are retained.  However, permission is not and will not be
    granted for the sale or promotional use of this program or program
    documentation, or for use in any situation in which profit may be
    considered an objective, since it is the desire of the authors to
    respect the copyrights of the originators of Star Trek.

The &quot;or for use in any situation in which profit may be considered an 
objective&quot; is a problem, because it conflicts with the Open Source
Definition.  OSD forbids such restrictions because there is no
bright-line test for commercial use.  To see why this is a problem,
consider whether or not this license bars redistribution of SST
on the same CD-ROM as a for-profit Linux distribution.

One module formerly included with the source, conio.[ch], had an LGPL 
license on it.  However, the SST code no longer uses it 

I would like to replace the SST license with BSD, and add the following
language to the documentation:

    This game is intended as a tribute, not an act of piracy; the authors
    have every wish to respect the copyrights, trademarks, and other legal
    and moral rights of the originators of Star Trek.  We recognize and
    support their right under the Berne Convention to recover damages for
    any uses of this program which divert profits from them or compromise
    their legitimate interest in protecting their copyrights and
    trademarks.

THE ROADMAP FOR THE FUTURE:

I want to add a &quot;wayback machine&quot; option that can restrict the game to
the original pre-Super featues as described by Dave Matuszek.

I've separated the game engine from its interface pretty cleanly --
the evidence for this is that all the differences between the curses
and tty modes are isolated in io.c.  Next step: add a GUI.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

If you are an original coauthor:

1. Download sst from &lt;<A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/projects/sst/">https://developer.berlios.de/projects/sst/</A>&gt;.

2. Play it and critique it.  If any of the SST2K changes seem
   inauthentic, say so.

3. If you can find Paul Reynolds, Don Smith. Jim Korp or Grady Hicks,
   try to bring them in on this project.

4. Read the history section in the documentation.  Correct as necessary.  The
   Wikipedia says &quot;According to the documentation, it was inspired by
   and rather loosely based on an earlier game programmed in BASIC by
   Jim Korp and Grady Hicks at The University of Texas at Austin,
   which in turn was derived from a still earlier version written at
   Penn State University&quot;  Is this true?

If you are Tom Almy:

1.  This version is immediately descended from the one you have made available
    at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.almy.us/sst.html">http://www.almy.us/sst.html</A>&gt;.  Can we interest you in porting
    SST2K to MacOS X and Windows consoles?

2. We believe, but are not absolutely certain, that we have your June
   2004 fixes.  Would you please check?

The kind of charity you can force out of people nourishes about as much as
the kind of love you can buy --- and spreads even nastier diseases.
